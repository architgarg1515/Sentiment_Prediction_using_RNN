## Project Overview

<p align="justify">In this notebook, we implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using a RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.</p>

The architecture for this network is shown below:

### Results

We get a 83% accuracy in predicting the sentiments on the test set.
